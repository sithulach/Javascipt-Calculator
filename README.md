# Javascipt-Calculator
Hello there tech-savy people,
I created this calculator app from scratch using pure Javascript, CSS and HTML. I hope you enjoy this progran I created.
Also this program is open source with a MIT licence so feel free to edit, upload and distribute your own variant of it.
Cheers,
Sithula Vithanage
For the program I added special arrows to toggle the textbox1 or textbox2.
